## 🇵🇷 _Boricua aunque naciera en la Luna_
My name is Jacob M. Delgado López and I am from San Juan, Puerto Rico, located in the north side of Puerto Rico. I'm currently a senior at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

## 🧬 Research Interests
- **AI for Social Impact:** disease diagnosis, agricultural monitoring, environmental conservation
- **Machine Learning:** transfer learning, knowledge distillation
- **Biomedical Engineering:** accesible healthtech, disease prevention

## 📍 Current work
Currently, I'm in working in the Edge Computing Group at UPRM where I explorE various strategies to compress large machine-learning models to run inferences on embedded systems. The main challenge is selecting an embedded device and identifying a model that can be compressed without compromising accuracy based on the device's resource constraints. Two paper's were submmited to the International Symposium on Intelligent Computing and Networking 2025
