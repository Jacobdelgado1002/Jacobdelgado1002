## üáµüá∑ _Boricua aunque naciera en la Luna_
My name is Jacob M. Delgado L√≥pez and I am from San Juan, Puerto Rico. I'm currently a senior at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez (UPRM) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I aim to leverage AI and data science to create innovative solutions for societal challenges for underprivileged communities like mine. 

## üß¨ Research Interests
- **AI for Social Impact:** disease diagnosis, agricultural monitoring, environmental conservation
- **Machine Learning:** transfer learning, knowledge distillation
- **Biomedical Engineering:** accesible healthtech, disease prevention

## üìç Current work
Currently, I am working in the Edge Computing Group at UPRM, exploring strategies to compress large machine-learning models for running inferences on embedded systems. My primary challenge is selecting an embedded device and identifying a model that can be compressed without compromising accuracy based on the device's resource constraints. 

Two papers were recently submitted to the International Symposium on Intelligent Computing and Networking 2025:
1. **[Computer Vision for Real-Time MonkeyPox Diagnosis on Embedded Systems]**: Creating a web-based a diagnosis tool for monkeypox leveraging computer vision.
2. **[Model Compression Engine for Wearable Devices Skin Cancer Diagnosis]**: Developing an optimization pipeline for skin cancer diagnosis.

## üåü Featured Projects
- **[Computer Vision for Real-Time MonkeyPox Diagnosis on Embedded Systems](#)**: Embedded systems and model compression techniques can make AI tools more accessible in resource-constrained environments such as rural areas and disaster-prone regions. This project involved creating and deploying a diagnosis tool for MonkeyPox on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano using the TensorRT framework. The baseline model obtained a 94% F1-Score pre-compression and post-compression for FP32, FP16, and INT8 while significantly reducing the power consumption by a factor of 2.
- **[Model Compression Engine for Wearable Devices Skin Cancer Diagnosis](#)**: AI-powered healthcare solutions can provide rapid and reliable diagnoses in places lacking healthcare infrastructure. This work seeks to illustrate the viability of AI deployment in biomedical applications where computational resources are limited. The focus is on creating a real-time skin cancer diagnostic tool for deployment on the Rasberry Pi and Arduino Nano. The initial model obtained an F1-Score of 85% and current experiments involve utilizing LiteRT and Apache TVM for compression.
- **[Articulated Object Grasp Generation Utilizing Part-Wise Segmentation](#)**: For robots to interact well in human environments, they must have the capability to manipulate articulated objects. My research gauged the effectiveness of utilizing Contact-GraspNet (CGN) grasp generation and partwise segmentation techniques for generating good grasps. This baseline would help strengthen the conclusions of my lab‚Äôs AO-Grasp paper submission. The baseline demonstrated a high success rate of approximately 80% when determining good grasps on everyday household objects.
- **[Sim2Real Transfer for Capacitive Sensors Utilizing Assistive Gym‚Äôs Capacitive Sensing Simulation Framework](#)**: This project sought to address safety concerns related to human-robot interaction by leveraging a novel method involving capacitive sensors and exploring the feasibility of Sim2Real transfer. I designed and manufactured a tool with built-in capacitive sensors to collect data. In tandem, I utilized the Assistive Gym capacitive sensing simulation framework to gather data in simulation as the basis for Sim2Real transfer. My findings gave insights into efficient Sim2Real transfer by optimizing simulation parameters like the number of electrode nodes and the permittivity.
